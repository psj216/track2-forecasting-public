"""A minimal REASONING agent: the mechanism the track is named for, and nothing more.

## Why this file exists

`baselines/` holds five text-blind adapters. Every one of them reports
`real_adapter_implemented: False` and returns a Gaussian random walk, and each says in its own
metadata that it never opens the corpus. They are the floor a reasoning agent has to beat, and
they are honest about being placeholders -- but between them and a submission there was nothing
showing how a forecast is supposed to USE `/input/text/` at all.

This is that missing example. It is deliberately the smallest thing that demonstrates the loop:

    read the dated corpus  ->  ask the house model for two numbers  ->  move the distribution

It is NOT a competitive method and is not tuned. If it beats the statistical floor, that gap is
the quantity the track exists to measure; if it does not, that is a real result about this prompt
and this model, not a bug in the harness.

## What it does, precisely

The numeric half is the joint Gaussian random walk from
`qfbench2_track_forecasting/cli.py` -- correlated across assets from the empirical covariance of
daily changes, because the composite puts 0.3 on the joint variogram term and independently drawn
marginals are penalised there by design. That part is imported, not reimplemented.

The reasoning half asks the model for exactly two scalars per asset:

    drift_bp    a directional shift, in basis points of the MAGNITUDE of the as-of level,
                applied to the mean and clamped to +-3 horizon standard deviations
    vol_scale   a multiplier on the standard deviation, clamped to [0.5, 2.0]

Two scalars rather than a distribution because they are auditable: a reviewer can read them in
`forecast_rationale.md`, compare them against the documents, and disagree. A model asked for 500
draws directly would produce numbers nobody can check.

`drift_bp` is stated against the level's MAGNITUDE, not the signed level, and both the level and
the horizon standard deviation go into the prompt. Track 2 panels are not all prices: 11 of the
169 shipped asset-series have a negative as-of anchor, and against the signed level "up 250 bp"
moved those distributions DOWN. A further 14 have an anchor small enough that 250 bp of it is
under 2% of the forecast's own width, which is why the model is told that width and the drift is
bounded in units of it. Everything the model sends is still checked before it is used: `NaN` and
`Infinity` are legal JSON literals to `json.loads` and an unguarded one produces an all-NaN
parquet that `g3_domain_semantics` refuses, so a non-finite scalar drops that asset's adjustment
and says so in the ledger.

## The cutoff is enforced here, not assumed

`corpus_index.json` carries a `timestamp` per document and the harness gates on it (g2), but a
submission that reads a file the index dates after `--asof` has already leaked before any gate
runs. This filters on the index and refuses to read anything later, and records how many documents
that excluded. `note` in the shipped indexes is explicit that minutes and COT timestamps are
PUBLIC RELEASE dates, which is what makes them usable at all.

## Failure is labelled, never silent

If `MODEL_ENDPOINT` is unset, or the call fails, or the reply does not parse, the forecast is the
unadjusted statistical floor and both `forecast_meta.json` and `forecast_rationale.md` say so:

    reasoning_applied: false
    reasoning_skipped_reason: "<why>"

Those two keys are machine-readable in the sidecar, not prose only: a reviewer counting how many
submissions actually reached a model should not have to parse markdown to find out.

The five placeholder adapters were corrected once for claiming a provenance they did not have
(`theta_arima.py:134-141`). The same rule applies here: an agent that silently degrades to the
floor while reporting itself as a reasoning run makes every uplift number downstream meaningless.

## Usage

    MODEL_ENDPOINT=https://... MODEL_NAME=... \
      python3 -m baselines.reasoning_agent \
        --panels /input/panels --text /input/text --asof 2024-05-31 \
        --card /input/card.toml --out /output/forecast.parquet

Reads only `/input`, writes only `/output`, and calls nothing but `MODEL_ENDPOINT`.

    Three things the model can send that must not reach the parquet:

    * **Non-finite numbers.** `json.loads` accepts the bare literals `NaN` and `Infinity`, so a
      model that emits either produces an all-NaN forecast -- measured: 500 of 500 rows invalid,
      `g3_domain_semantics` fails, `admissible: false`. Silently writing a submission that is
      guaranteed to be refused is the same silent-degradation failure this file exists to avoid,
      so a non-finite scalar drops that asset's adjustment and records why.
    * **A negative as-of level.** `drift_bp` is basis points of the anchor, and 11 of the 169
      shipped asset-series have a NEGATIVE anchor (`t2-F1-ai-mom-2024` MOM is -0.0065). Against
      the raw anchor, "up 250 bp" moved those distributions DOWN. The magnitude is used, so the
      documented meaning -- positive is up -- holds on every card.
    * **An unbounded drift.** `drift_bp` had no ceiling: a reply of 1e12 moved the mean to 1e8
      and still passed every gate. The shift is clamped to a few horizon standard deviations,
      which is the only scale on which "large" means anything across yields, FX and factors.
